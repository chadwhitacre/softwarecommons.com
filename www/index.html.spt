<h1>Software Commons</h1>

<img class="meadow" src="/softwarecommons.background.webp">

<blockquote>
  The <i>software commons</i> consists of all computer software which is
  available at little or no cost and which can be reused with few
  restrictions. It includes open source software[.] However the commons
  also includes software outside of these categories[.]
</blockquote>

<h2>Pitch</h2>

<p> Public software sharing is great, for <a
  href="https://chat.openai.com/share/f6a2f760-f3e8-485d-a61e-ff834cbc95d3">a
  number of reasons</a>. But like any <a
  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons">commons</a>,
the commons of publicly shared software must be protected against two
threats:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enclosure"><b>enclosure</b></a>, a minority gaining control and unfairly limiting access to others; and</li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons"><b>tragedy</b> of the commons</a>, the majority using more than their fair share, degrading and possibly even destroying the commons.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the former case there are <i>too many</i> restrictions, in the latter
there are <i>too few</i>. Managing a healthy, sustainable commons means
balancing between the two extremes, and Software Commons does so using two
mechanisms: <a href="/about/licensing">licensing</a>, and the <a
href="/about/fair-share">Fair Share</a>. We recognize both <a
href="/about/open-source-projects">Open Source Projects</a> and <a
href="/about/open-products">Open Products</a> as legitimate.</p>
