## Pitch

Public software sharing is great, for [a number of reasons][2]. But like any
[commons][3], the commons of publicly shared software must be protected against
two threats:

- [**enclosure**][4], a minority gaining control and unfairly limiting access
  to others; and
- [**tragedy** of the commons][5], the majority using more than their fair
  share, degrading and possibly even destroying the commons.

In the former case there are _too many_ restrictions, in the latter there are
_too few_. Managing a healthy, sustainable commons means balancing between the
two extremes, and Software Commons does so using two mechanisms:
[licensing][6], and [Fair Share][7]. We recognize both [Open Source
Projects][8] and [Open Products][9] as legitimate.
