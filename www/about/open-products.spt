Open Products are an important part of the publicly shared software in our
society (the largest part are [Open Source
Projects](../open-source-projects/)). An Open Product is a commercial offering
from a company for which the source code is publicly shared.

[Open Source Projects](../open-source-projects/) have proven themselves to
excel at producing systems software such as Linux and FreeBSD, and development
languages and tools such as JavaScript, Python, Emacs, Vim, and many, many
others. While closed-source alternatives exist (Windows, MATLAB, JetBrains),
Open Source has carried the day for certain classes of software.

Where Open Source has _not_ succeeded is in consumer-grade software products.
Think Google Search, the Facebook News Feed, or Microsoft Teams. The software
that constitutes the vast majority of our society's digital experience is fully
closed source. For [a number of reasons][1], it would be worth celebrating if
instead, the vast majority of our society's source code was publicly shared.

Open Products are <b>**core product offerings from for-profit companies for
which the source code is publicly shared**</b>. Open Source
[licenses](../licensing/) do not incorprate developer sustainability and
therefore do not protect against the [tragedy of the
commons](../tragedy-of-the-commons/). They are not suitable for Open Products.
Evolving this new category of Open Products is one of the core activities of
Software Commons. The first license we recommend for adoption is the [Functional
Source License (FSL)][2].
