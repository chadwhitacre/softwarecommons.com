      <h1>Software Commons</h1>

      <blockquote>
        The <i>software commons</i> consists of all computer software which is
        available at little or no cost and which can be reused with few
        restrictions. It includes open source software[.] However the commons
        also includes software outside of these categories[.]
      </blockquote>

        (<a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Information_commons&oldid=1186082015#Software_commons"
          >Wikipedia</a
        >)
      </p>

      <h2>Pitch</h2>

      <p>
        Public software sharing is good, for [reasons]. The established brand
        related to software sharing,
        <a href="https://opensource.org/">Open Source</a>, is interpreted by
        many to exclude certain kinds of sharing that are nevertheless also
        good. <b>Software Commons is a brand</b> with a slightly wider focus. It
        encompasses all Free and Open Source Software (FOSS), along with
        additional practices. This website exists to educate the software
        industry about beneficial sharing practices beyond Open Source,
        particularly the
        <a href="/sustainable-source/">Sustainable Source</a> model.
      </p>

      <h3>The Limits of Open Source</h3>

      <p>
        Open Source is great for shared infrastructure, and as the foundation
        for certain kinds of business models (primarily service-based). However,
        Open Source licenses are a double-edged sword. They create the
        possibility for communities to form around software projects, but they
        do not adequately protect against
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-rider_problem"
          >harmful free-riding</a
        >, which can lead to a
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons"
          >tragedy of the commons</a
        >.
      </p>

      <p>
        Many Open Source-aligned founders of software companies <i>want</i> to
        share the code for their <b>core software products</b>, not just
        infrastructure. Copyleft is one strategy to combat harmful free-riding,
        but it is not right for every company. Many founders are more aligned
        with permissive Open Source. Fortunately, there are good alternatives:
        <a href="/open-core/">Open Core</a> and
        <a href="/sustainable-source/">Sustainable Source</a>.
      </p>

      <h3>Comparison with Creative Commons</h3>

      <p>
        Software Commons is like
        <a href="https://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a> for
        software. Creative Commons is explicitly
        <a
          href="https://creativecommons.org/faq/#can-i-apply-a-creative-commons-license-to-software"
          ><i>not</i> for software</a
        >, but it takes in a wider scope of creative works than Open Source does
        software. The Creative Commons motto is, &ldquo;<a
          href="https://creativecommons.org/faq/#what-does-some-rights-reserved-mean"
          >Some rights reserved</a
        >.&rdquo; It includes licenses that
        <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/"
          >restrict commercial use</a
        >, and licenses that
        <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/"
          >restrict modification</a
        >. A strict definition of Open Source does not allow for such
        restrictions. Software Commons is a superset of Open Source that
        acknowledges the validity of some restrictions on sharing in order to
        curtail harmful free-riding.
      </p>

      <div class="img"><img src="cc.webp" /></div>

      <p>
        That said, Software Commons is also unlike Creative Commons. We are not
        a formal non-profit, and we do not provide a comprehensive suite of
        licenses. Established groups already do that. For example, the Open
        Source Initiative
        <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/">defines licenses</a> for the
        Open Source subset of Software Commons, and SPDX provides
        <a href="https://spdx.org/licenses/"
          >exhaustive license classification</a
        >.
      </p>

      <p>
        Software Commons is focused on education about sharing practices beyond
        Open Source, particularly
        <a href="/sustainable-source">Sustainable Source</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>Five Main Types of Software Sharing</h2>

      <p>
        There are five broad categories of sharing practices in the software
        industry. All software released under any of these practices is part of
        Software Commons.
      </p>

      <dl>
        <dt>
          <a href="/public-domain/">Public Domain</a>
        </dt>
        <dd>Fewest restrictions. (CC0, WTFPL)</dd>

        <dt>

        <dd>
          Restrictions to enforce reciprocal sharing. (GPL, AGPL, LGPL, MPL)
        </dd>

        <dt>

        </dt>
        <dd>Restrictions on competition. (FSL, BUSL, ELv2)</dd>
      </dl>

      <h2>What Software Commons is Not</h2>

      <dl>
        <dt>
          <a href="/source-available/">Source Available</a>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          Source Available is a highly ambiguous category, encompassing some
          software that is part of Software Commons, and much that is not (for
          example, code that is readable by customers under NDA but not by the
          public). We recommend against the use of this term.
        </dd>

        <dt>Closed Source</dt>

        <dd>Closed-source software is not part of the Software Commons.</dd>
