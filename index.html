      <h1>Software Commons Consortium</h1>

      <p>The Software Commons Consortium (SCC) <b>promotes sharing in the
        software industry</b>.</p>

      <h2>Definition of the Software Commons</h2>

      <p>
        <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_commons#Software_commons"
          >From Wikipedia</a
        >:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        The <i>software commons</i> consists of all computer software which is
        available at little or no cost and which can be reused with few
        restrictions. It includes open source software which can be modified
        with few restrictions. However the commons also includes software
        outside of these categories â€“ for instance, software which is in the
        public domain.
      </blockquote>


      <h2>Mini-manifesto</h2>

      <p>We believe that public software sharing is a good practice, for [reasons].
      The established brand related to software sharing, <a
        href="https://opensource.org/">Open Source</a>, is interpreted by many
      to preclude certain kinds of sharing that we nevertheless wish to
      promote. SCC recognizes the definitions of the Free and Open Source
      Software (FOSS) movement, while widening our focus to encompass additional
      sharing practices within the Software Commons.</p>

      <p>We especially encourage companies to share their core software
      products under licenses that grant extensive freedoms while protecting
      their commercial interests.</p>

      <p><a
             href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source-available_software">Source
             Available</a> is a related but highly ambiguous category,
           encompassing much software that is not part of the Software Commons
           (for example, code that is readable by customers under NDA but not
           by the public).</p>

      <p>Our long-term goal is to grow the Software Commons into a brand as
      strong as Open Source. Our ideal future headline is along the lines of,
      &ldquo;Microsoft Windows is now part of the Software Commons.&rdquo;</p>


      <h2>Types of Software Sharing</h2>

      <p>SCC recognizes several broad categories of sharing practices in the
      software industry. All software released under any of these practices is
      part of the Software Commons.</p>

      <h2>Cramer's Notes</h2>

      <p>
        The intent here is to normalize a category of software which provides
        more freedom than closed source, and more freedom than typical
        source-available software. It should not diminish the value of FOSS (or
        OSI's definition of "Open Source"), but should also not be overly
        confusing to end-users, and not include prejudice.
      </p>

      <p>
        We need a way to talk about licenses like FSL, BUSL, and arguably even
        things like Elastic. They cannot be called Open Source (and we should
        make that clear in our faq/whatever). They are not Closed Source. They
        are different than source-available.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is a marketing exercise at the end of the day, so I'm not looking
        for academic opinions here. This is about what public perception is and
        needs to be. We need a term that aligns with the freedoms we're granted,
        but does not diminish the value of Open Source.
      </p>

      <p>
        Aside, I would love if we can just bucket these licenses into COSS. I
        dont think thats going to sit well with some, but thats really what they
        are at the end of the day.
      </p>

      <p>
        Additionally many COSS projects, while thought of as Open Source, are
        simply not. They're often open core where the meat of the project is
        closed source or otherwise a proprietary/fully restricted license.
      </p>

      <p>
        I do think in general tho these kinds of licenses, including the Open
        Core model, fit very well with the concept of COSS.
      </p>

      <p>
        I dont intend to brand FSL under its own unique snowflake terminology.
        My intent is to focus the conversation around all forms of software
        which aren't open source, which includes a large amount of open core.
        This matters because many of those businesses effectively make a similar
        compromise to FSL (and some other non-compete variants), and is even
        more important because the approach of the FSL to many users has more
        value than the approach of hyper restrictive open core (think where e.g.
        50% of the product is proprietary, or the key features). Otherwise we'd
        just call it non-compete and be done with it.
      </p>

      <p>
        There may not be a clean solution, but I think its important that the
        community separates FOSS from semi-open source projects, otherwise
        there's no real defense on why open core gets plastered as open source
        and something like FSL doesn't. Its also worth knowing that no one will
        care about this except us - end users will still just care that the
        software is primarily free, so its important to ensure that remains
        obvious to people.
